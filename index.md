# Game Design in Unity
My Project is to create a game using a game engone called unity. I am going to create a 3D platformer game using blender and Unity. I created the character and animations for it in blender and then uploaded them into unity. Then I created the platforms in unity that my character would be jumping on.

# First Milestone 
For my first milestone I went into blender and made a 3d mesh that resembled a character. Next I setup the mesh so it was attached to a rig that would allow me to animate the mesh. Then I made animations of the character running and jumping. Then I imported the character into Unity and made it so the player could control the character with the wasd keys.
