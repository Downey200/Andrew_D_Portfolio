# Game Design in Unity
My Project is to create a game using a game engone called unity. I am going to create a 3D platformer game using blender and Unity. I created the character and animations for it in blender and then uploaded them into unity. Then I created the platforms in unity that my character would be jumping on.

# Second Milestone
I imported the animation files and character from blender into Unity. I then opened a C# script and coded the character to be able to move fowards and backwards with the W and S keys. I then coded in gravity so the character would not be walking on air. Then I added so the player could rotate the character using their mouse.

# First Milestone 
For my first milestone I went into blender and sculpted a 3d mesh that resembled a character. Next I setup the mesh so it was attached to a rig which acted as bones. I used the rig that I had made for the character to position it in a way to be animated. I made animations for the character wich could play during the game when the character was running and jumping.
