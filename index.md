# A Robot that Uses Computer Vision to Track a Ball
My Project is a robot that can track a ball using computer vision. My projects main components include a rapsberry pi, 4 motors, a motor driver, an ultra sonic sensor, and a battery pack. I uploaded code to the rapberry Pi that would tell the ultra sonic sensor to track the ball, and according to the information from the sensor it would then tell the motors to move accordingly.

# First Milestone 
For my first milestone I assembled the chasse and attached the motors and wheels. Next I setup my raspberry pi so I could add code to it whenever I wanted. Then I wired the motors to connect to the motor driver. Then I wired the Raspberry Pi so that it was connected to the motor driver. I had to take a apart and re-assemble my chasse twice because I did not follow the directions carefully both times. I learned from these mistakes and have not experienced any difficultly since then.
